# MyoQuant-Streamlit

MyoQuant-Streamlit is a demo web application to showcase usage of MyoQuant.
MyoQuant is a command line tool to quantify pathological feature in histology images.
It is built using CellPose, Stardist, custom neural-network models and image analysis techniques to automatically analyze myopathy histology images.
This web application is intended for demonstration purposes only.

## How to install or deploy

The demo version is deploayed at https://lbgi.fr/MyoQuant/. You can deploy your own demo version using Docker, your own python environnement or google Colab for GPU support.

### Docker

You can build the docker image by running `docker build -t streamlit .` and launch the container using `docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit`.

### Non-Docker

If you do not want to use Docker you can install the poetry package in a miniconda (python 3.9, 3.10) base env, run `poetry install` to install the python env, activate the env with `poetry shell` and launch the app by running `streamlit run Home.py`.

### Deploy on Google Colab for GPU

As this application uses various deep-learning model, you could benefit from using a deployment solution that provides a GPU.  
To do so, you can leverage Google Colab free GPU to boost this Streamlit application.  
To run this app on Google Colab, simply clone the notebook called `google_colab_deploy.ipynb` into Colab and run the four cells. It will automatically download the latest code version, install dependencies and run the app. A link will appear in the output of the lat cell with a structure like `https://word1-word2-try-01-234-567-890.loca.lt`. Click it and the click continue and you’re ready to use the app!

## How to Use

Once on the demo, click on the corresponding staining analysis on the sidebar, and upload your histology image. Results will be displayed in the main area automatically.
